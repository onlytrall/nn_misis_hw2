Sonic the Hedgehog hopped over to a treehouse by the pond on the outskirts of the forest. He curled up on the picnic blanket, accompanied by his friends Faffy Murder Tales and Gloria the Marmalade Lady Joe.
They gathered food, and Sonic complained about not being able to climb the ladder for the sprinkler. The treehouse looked down at Sonic, and a big, friendly bird dove down to greet him, pecking his fur gently.
Hearing Sonic's grumpy voice, the bird gently squished the hedgehogs' cling film onto the treehouse's roof. Sonic was relieved, and the p premature happy song of the quirky bird filled the air.
Oh look, Sonic made a new best friend!
